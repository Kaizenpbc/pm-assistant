## 🧪 **TEST SCENARIOS**

### **SCENARIO 1: Basic Schedule Loading**
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Login (if required)
3. Go to Dartmouth project → View Schedule

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Should show "Loading schedule data..." initially
- ✅ Should load existing schedule from database (if any)
- ✅ Should show blank schedule if none exists
- ✅ Console should show: `=== LOADING SCHEDULE FROM DATABASE ===`

### **SCENARIO 2: Save Schedule**
**Steps:**
1. On SchedulePage, click "Save Schedule"
2. Check browser console for logs

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Console should show: `=== SAVING SCHEDULE TO DATABASE ===`
- ✅ Should create new schedule in database
- ✅ Should show "Schedule saved successfully!" message

### **SCENARIO 3: Add Phases & Save**
**Steps:**
1. Click "Add Phases" button
2. Select "Project Initiation Phase"
3. Click "Save Schedule"
4. Navigate to Dashboard → View Schedule

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Phase tasks should appear in schedule
- ✅ Tasks should persist after navigation
- ✅ No duplicate schedules should be created

### **SCENARIO 4: AI Task Breakdown**
**Steps:**
1. Click "AI Task Breakdown" button
2. Generate tasks for "School Construction"
3. Click "Save Schedule"
4. Navigate away and back

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ AI-generated tasks should appear
- ✅ Tasks should be organized by phases
- ✅ Tasks should persist after navigation

### **SCENARIO 5: Browser Refresh**
**Steps:**
1. Create schedule with tasks
2. Press F5 to refresh browser
3. Check if data reloads

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Schedule should reload from database
- ✅ All tasks should reappear
- ✅ No data loss

## 🚀 **TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Manual Testing Steps:**

1. **Open Browser**: Go to http://localhost:3000
2. **Open Developer Tools**: F12 → Console tab
3. **Navigate to Schedule**: Dartmouth project → View Schedule
4. **Test Each Scenario**: Follow the steps above
5. **Check Console**: Look for the debug logs
6. **Verify Persistence**: Navigate away and back to confirm data persists

### **What to Look For:**

**✅ Success Indicators:**
- Loading states appear and disappear
- Console shows proper debug logs
- Data persists across navigation
- No error messages in console
- Tasks appear correctly in schedule table

**❌ Failure Indicators:**
- Blank schedule with no loading states
- Console errors about network requests
- Data doesn't persist after navigation
- Multiple schedules being created
- Tasks not appearing after save

## 🎯 **EXPECTED OUTCOME**

After all fixes, the scheduling module should:
- ✅ Load existing schedules from database
- ✅ Save new schedules and tasks correctly
- ✅ Persist data across navigation and refresh
- ✅ Show proper loading and error states
- ✅ Handle all task types (phases, AI breakdown)
- ✅ Maintain data consistency

**The scheduling module should now work exactly as expected!** 🎉
