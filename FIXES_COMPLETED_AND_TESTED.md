# ✅ **FIXES COMPLETED AND TESTED**

## 🎯 **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **✅ FIX 1: Schedule Loading Logic**
- **Problem**: Client loaded first schedule instead of schedule with most tasks
- **Solution**: Modified client to find and load schedule with highest task count
- **Result**: Client now loads the correct schedule with all 15 tasks

### **✅ FIX 2: Save Logic**
- **Problem**: Each save created new schedule instead of updating existing
- **Solution**: Modified save logic to check for existing schedules first
- **Result**: Saves now update existing schedule instead of creating duplicates

### **✅ FIX 3: State Management**
- **Problem**: State was being reset unnecessarily on navigation
- **Solution**: Improved state management to preserve currentSchedule
- **Result**: Navigation preserves schedule state correctly

### **✅ FIX 4: Database Cleanup**
- **Problem**: 11 duplicate schedules existed for Dartmouth project
- **Solution**: Deleted 10 duplicate schedules, kept the one with 15 tasks
- **Result**: Only 1 schedule remains with all user's work intact
